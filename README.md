# FINAL-PROJECT-1
To Predict Breast Cancer using SVM and Ensemble ML models..

STEP 1: Problem Statement:
  Given the details of cell nuclei taken from breast mass, predict whether or not a patient
  has breast cancer using the SVM and Ensembling Techniques. Perform necessary exploratory
  data analysis before building the model and evaluate the model based on performance
  metrics other than model accuracy.
  
STEP 2: Data collection:
  Importing Necessary packages like Pandas, Numpy, SKlearn, Seaborn, Matplotlib etc.
